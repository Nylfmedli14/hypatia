A lifelong Bible student, Mrs. Eddy was healed of a severe injury in 1866 as she read the account of one of Jesus\' healings in the New Testament. The healing led her to the conviction that healing through prayer is a natural and normal aspect of the Christian experience and to the discovery of what she understood as the Science of Christianity. She later wrote the Christian Science textbook (1875), established the Church of Christ, Scientist (1879), and established the Christian Science periodicals, including The Christian Science Monitor (1908).", "basicBeliefs": "The brief religious tenets of Christian Science are given on p. 497 of Science and Health, and read: 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal life. 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, One Christ; the holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God\'s image and likeness. 3. We acknowledge God\'s forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts. 4. We acknowledge Jesus\' atonement as the evidence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man\'s unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-Shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death. 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to understand eternal Life, even the all Ness of Soul, and the nothingness of matter. 6. And we solemnly promise to watch and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and to be merciful, just and pure.\' The teachings of Christian Science are rooted in the Bible. The basic theological and ethical statements of Christian Science are set forth in the denominational textbook, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy.", "practices": "The moral code of Christian Science is contained in the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount.

In answer to this prayer, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him to inform him that none were right, but that the fullness of the gospel would be revealed to him in the future. Later, the Angel Moroni delivered to him an ancient record, on gold plates, containing the history and religious teachings of a people who had migrated from Jerusalem to America some 600 years before Christ. These people, believed by the Mormons to be forefathers of at least some of the American Indians, had recorded their religious experiences, including a record of their encounter with the resurrected Christ. These were translated and published by Joseph Smith, Jr., and are known as The Book of Mormon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized on April 6, 1830, in the home of Peter Whitner in Fayette, New York, by Joseph Smith, Jr., and five others.

We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ: second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. 5.

{"name": "THE FAMILY OF LOVE ADDRESS", "historicalRoots": "The Family of Love evolved out of revivalist movements affecting the California youth culture in the late 1960s led by the Rev. David Brandt Berg. At first they took the name \"Teens for Christ\" and later were called the Children of God by the news media, after Berg\'s followers travel led through the United States on an Exodus-like trek in 1969, settling in Texas in 1970. Although the focus of much controversy, the Children became a highly mobile and evangelical body and continued to grow. In the mid-seventies they have attempted to replace their revolutionary image with one more conservative, emphasizing a settled existence of colonies in urban centers. They also adopted the name Family of Love.", "basicBeliefs": "The Family of Love bases its teachings on the Bible, the Revolutionary handbook of Jesus Christ, as expounded by the prophetic leader, Moses David. They believe that all people have sinned, and that the wages of sin is death, but that the gift of God is eternal life. They believe that all evil governments will suffer God\'s judgments and that the motivation of much of established society is corrupt; i.e., greed and selfishness. They believe that much of the religious establishment is doing little to teach their members to evangelize the world, but that there are millions of other Christians who really witness and win souls both in and out of the churches. They believe that God has in His love sent his Son Jesus Christ into the world so that all who believe in him will be saved by faith (Ephesians 2: 8-9). Following the New Testament example, they sell all that they have, give all property and income to the Family of Love, and hold all things in common. They believe that they are given power by the holy spirit to witness for Jesus, and that this holy Spirit sends them into the world to preach the Gospel to others. They believe that disciples must be willing to avoid worldly entanglements, and to suffer affliction gladly. The Family of Love accepts as equal in authority the Bible and those of Moses David\'s writings which are inspirational prophetic. Both are considered to be the word of God. The writings of Moses David are published in a series of letters. called MO Letters.", "practices": "Ethical guidelines are drawn from the Bible as interpreted by Moses David.

{"name": "THE FOUNDATION FAITH OF GOD", "historicalRoots": "In 1963, a group of professionals of several nationalities from the U.S., Canada, and Europe came together to initiate a movement which was to become the Foundation Faith of God. From 1963 to 1974, they worked extensively in the social service field, including individual and group counseling and establishment of centers in a number of American cities (providing a community coffeehouse, courses and lectures, and other services). The group\'s formative religious experience took place in 1966. In a type of religious retreat, the group (30 members) lived in a place called Xtul on the Yucatan peninsula. This period of intense examination was a time of religious and spiritual revelation for both the total group and for its individual members. A time of great asceticism, it functioned much as the Exodus did for the Jews. From this period came the strong and simple belief which forms the basis of the Foundation Faith. The group first started working in New Orleans in 1967. The Foundation Faith of the Millennium was incorporated in New York State in 1974.", "basicBeliefs": "The Foundation Faith believe that the world and mankind were created by God, named as Jehovah in certain versions of the Bible. God loves His people, and is manifest in history in the regard and punishment of His people. The world is beset with problems, both personal and social, and the only true answer is life devoted to God. It believes that God sent many prophets into the world to different races and cultures, to lead men to God, and to teach them to live according to God\'s laws, exemplified by the Ten Commandments. Much of the teaching is derived from the Bible, specifically the Gospels, but the validity of all religions which direct men to lead a good life devoted to the service of God and adherence to His laws is recognized. God and His teachings are seen as manifest in many different religions. Christ, Moses, Mohammed, Buddha, etc., were all sent by God to lead men to Him, although Christ holds a pre-eminent place. Many major religions foresee the coming of a messianic figure (known by many different names) to lead mankind into a new age or millennium ruled over by God and His laws. The Foundation Faith believes that these are the End Times, and within these times the Messiah, a representative of God, will appear to lead men back to God. Creed statements appear in the specific ritual of the Foundation Faith. The Bible is regarded as a major source of authority, and commentaries and/or articles regarding the beliefs of the Foundation Faith Religious Requirements and Practices appear in pamphlet form and in the periodicals published by the Faith.", "practices": "The Foundation\'s ethical practices encompass the normal stipulations required for a \"good life,\" following basic guidelines set down in the Bible and other holy literature. Special religious holidays are celebrated on June 13 (Foundation Day; which date represents this group\’s first initial gathering as a loosely organized body) and November 20th (Founder\’s Day). Founders take the day off work, and, if near a center, take part in religious services and festivals. Covenant Month (October 20--November 20), while not a holiday per se, commemorates the original religious experience of the group. Considerable activity takes place in all branches of the Foundation at that time.", "organization": "The Foundation Faith is organized along strict hierarchical lines, with ministers gaining seniority according to their experience and ability. The ranks of the ministry are: (1) Ordained Ministers are known as Reverend, including Luminaries, Minor Luminaries, and Celebrants; (2) Regular Ministers, known as Brother or Sister, including Mentors and Covenanters; and (3) Ministers-in-Training, including Witnesses and Aspirants. The Council of Luminaries is the governing body, and consists of all Luminaries and Minor Luminaries. A minister promoted to Minor Luminary automatically becomes a member of the Council. Ranks also exist within the laity, the most common being Lay Founder. These may serve as lay minister after instruction by a minister. The Foundation Faith is administered internationally from its Nevada headquarters. Other branches consist of both ministerial teams and lay members who conduct activities in the absence of ministerial personnel.", "books": ["The Bible, specifically the New Testament, and most specifically the Gospels."]}
